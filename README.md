# Password Encryption using Fernet

This Python script demonstrates how to encrypt a password using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm. It also includes a function to generate a Fernet key from a password and a random salt value.

## How to Use

1. **Installation**:

    - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
    - Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```
    pip install cryptography
    ```

2. **Usage**:

    - Run the script in your Python environment:

    ```
    python password_encryption.py
    ```

    - You will be prompted to enter your password. Once entered, the script will generate a Fernet key from the password and a random salt value, and then encrypt the password using the generated key.
    - The encrypted password and the generated Fernet key will be printed to the console.

3. **Example**:

    ```
    Enter your password: [YourPassword]
    Generated Fernet Key: [GeneratedFernetKey]
    Encrypted Password: [EncryptedPassword]
    ```

4. **Additional Notes**:

    - Make sure to securely store the Fernet key and the salt value, as they are needed for decryption.
    - You can modify the script to integrate it into your application for secure password storage.

## Dependencies

- cryptography: Used for Fernet encryption and key derivation.

You can add more details or instructions as needed. This README provides a basic overview of the functionality and usage of your script.

# Fernet Encryption and Decryption

This Python script provides functions for encrypting and decrypting data using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm from the `cryptography` library.

## Functionality

- **encrypt_aes**: Encrypts the provided data using the Fernet encryption algorithm and returns the encrypted data as a base64-encoded string.
- **decrypt_aes**: Decrypts the provided encrypted data using the Fernet decryption algorithm.

## Usage

1. **Installation**:
    - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
    - Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```
    pip install cryptography
    ```

2. **Encryption**:
    - Call the `encrypt_aes` function with the secret key and the data to be encrypted.
    - It returns the encrypted data as a base64-encoded string.

    ```python
    encrypted_data = encrypt_aes(secret_key, data)
    ```

3. **Decryption**:
    - Call the `decrypt_aes` function with the secret key and the encrypted data.
    - It returns the decrypted data.

    ```python
    decrypted_data = decrypt_aes(secret_key, encrypted_data)
    ```

4. **Example**:
    ```python
    import base64
    from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

    # Example secret key and data
    secret_key = "your_secret_key_here"
    data = "your_data_here"

    encrypted_data = encrypt_aes(secret_key, data)
    decrypted_data = decrypt_aes(secret_key, encrypted_data)

    print("Original Data:", data)
    print("Encrypted Data:", encrypted_data)
    print("Decrypted Data:", decrypted_data)
    ```

## Error Handling

- The script raises an `EncryptionKeyException` if an invalid secret key is provided during encryption or decryption.

## Dependencies

- cryptography: Used for Fernet encryption and decryption.

##steps for encrytption and decryption
1. run the key file and enter the password and you will get the secret code and encryption key
2. now run the decription file and enter the secret code and encryption key in the code and you will get the password
   this way you can encrypt and decrypt password
